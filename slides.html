        **JavaScript** is a _programming_ language used to define the behaviour and used to add functionality to a website.

        Because JavaScript is a programming language, the structure and syntax include more complexities than HTML or CSS.

        #The Console

        Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of these JavaScript principles, let’s take a look at a tool called the console.

        We'll be using this tool in the upcoming exercises to focus on getting used to the programming syntax.

        This way, we can write programs without relying on HTML & CSS and learn some of the fundamental programming concepts first.

        The console in Chrome looks like this:

        **Important!** The blue `>` symbol represents a space to enter your input but you don't have to actually type the symbol.

        #Accessing the Console

        You can open the console when viewing _any_ HTML page. In Chrome, there are different ways to open the Console tab.

        Keyboard shortcut:
        `COMMAND + OPTION + J` (MAC)  / `CONTROL + SHIFT + J` (WINDOWS)

        OR

        Select: `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`.

        Open the console in this slide presentation. Take a moment to practice opening and closing the console until you’re comfortable with it.

        ---

        ###Pro tip!
        The console also shows any errors on the page so if you open the console on any existing web page, you *may* see some error messages.

        In the console, after the `>` symbol, type your favorite number and press the enter/return key. You will see something like this:

        ![console number](framework/img/workshop/console-number.gif) <!-- .element: width="85%" -->

        The ```>``` symbol represents a space for your input.
        The ```<``` symbol represents the **returned value** of your input.

        ---
        ###Pro tip!
        To increase the font size of the console, use `Command/Control +`.
        Use  `Command/Control 0` to return it back to the default size.

        * gives a *name* to a *value*.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        ```javascript
        let myVariable = "Hello!";
        ```

        The value `Hello` is given to the name `myVariable` and is declared using the keyword `let`. This is *assigning* a value to the *variable*.

        Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign the value to the variable on the left of the equals sign.

          * the result looks kind of like `camelHumps`

        * Cannot begin with:
          * a digit (0 - 9)

          * so variable names are also case sensitive
        * Use a descriptive names:

        #Class exercise: Using Variables

        When using the console tool, it will automatically return a value when you input an instruction. Declaring a variable just *stores* the value until you're ready to use it.

        `let favFood` is just holding on to the value, so it returns nothing (undefined). But now, JavaScript knows it exists.

        To actually **use** the variable, just type `favFood` into the console. It will now **return** the value that it was storing and look something like this:

        ```javascript
        > let favFood = "pizza";
        < undefined
        > favFood;
        < "pizza"

# Variable Types: Strings and Quotes

Strings values can be wrapped in either 'single quotes' or "double quotes." You can use either style but you must start and end the string with the same mark.

But be careful! In the example below, this will cause an error.

```javascript
let fails = 'This string's value is not going to work!';
/*          ^           ^
            |___________|
            |
            Javascript thinks the second apostrophe closes the first.
            It then expects the command to end with a semicolon (;)
            right after and returns an error.

        ```

        Or *escape* it by using a backslash.

        ```javascript
        let alsoWorks = 'This string\'s value will also work!';

        JavaScript can also do math.

        `+` addition, `-` subtraction, `*` multiplication, `/` division

        ```javascript
        let addition = 5 + 2;

        1. Declare variables & values for:
          * `secondsPerMinute`
          * `minutesPerHour`
          * `hoursPerDay`
        1. Declare a `secondsPerDay` variable and use arithmetic operators to calculate the value.
        1. **Bonus!** Use concatenation to output "There are x seconds per day."

        #Comments!

        Just like HTML and CSS, you can also leave comments in JavaScript.

        ```
        // This is how you leave a single line comment.

        // You can write many single line comments.
        // Just make sure to add the double slash
        // for every new line.
        ```

        Here's another way to comment larger blocks of text.

        ```javascript
        /* This is how you leave
        multi-line comments for when you
        want to write a longer message */
        ```

        Multi-line comments are great for "hiding" large blocks of code so you can try something new without erasing your old code.
        >**Careful:** Multi-line comments do not **nest**. That means you cannot place a multi-line comment inside another!

        **Objects** can be thought of as a variable that can hold *multiple* values. To *declare* an object, use the curly brackets `{}`.

        The values are written in `property: value` pairs. Each pair is separated by a comma, except for the last one.

        ```
        let myObject = {
          propertyName: propertyValue,

        * a comma (,) separates properties

        A `function` is a name for a **set** of commands or instructions.

        When using a function, it executes all the commands contained within, making it easier to make the code repeat repetitive steps.

        Let's look at two functions, `alert()` and `prompt()`.  These come built into JavaScript, for free! Note the syntax, the parentheses `()`, must be included.

        We've seen now that `alert()` and `prompt()` create a pop-ups in the browser but the pop-ups are blank.  An *argument* can be *passed* into the functions by adding a value within the parentheses `()`.

        Try this in the console:

        ```

        `alert()` is a **function**, it works on its own.

        `log()` is a **method** because it's attached to an **object**, `console`. It will log a message only into the console tool.

        #Setup() and Draw()

        These two functions can be confusing at first. setup(), though, is only ever run once. It does the basic construction, sets your overall preferences, sets the size of your canvas and sets the background colour. All your "initial states", as the lingo goes, go in the setup() function.

        The draw() function includes everything that's added on top of the initial state. In our case, that includes drawing a rectangle on top of our canvas background.
  
        ```
          setup() {

        #Coordinates are weird

        A lot of the elements you draw in Processing will use a coordinate system to tell them where they should be. These often look like your rect() function on the previous slides. 

        ```
          rect(10,20,130,260);
        ```

        These are x and y values, then the width and height values. So the top-left corner of the rectangle is at 10 pixels from the left of the canvas edge (the x value) and 20 pixels from the top of the canvas edge (the y value). 

        Then the lower-right corner of the rectangle is at 130 pixels from the left start position, and 260 pixels from the top start position. 

        Similarly, you can have an ellipse: 

        ```
          ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```
        
        The first set of coordinates is the center of the ellipse (x and y) and the second two numbers are how tall and wide it is.

        Up to now, we've known in theory that the draw() function runs 60 times per second and that can be used to animate your visualizations, but with our static rect() that's a little difficult to see.

        #Challenge: The case of the growing rect() (code-along)

        JavaScript lets you establish global variables that can start off as one value, but adjust as the program runs. So at the top of your script, add these two variables:

        ```
        let wide = 10;
        let high = 20;
        ```

        1. Draw a small rectangle on your page
        2. Make the rectangle grow on its own

        (the solution is the GrowingRectangleChallenge folder in your course notes)

        #Solution: The case of the growing rect()

        The trick here is that variables can be updated after you set them, which is part of what makes them very powerful. 

        So at the bottom of your draw() function, you can include this: 

        ```
          wide = wide + 0.1;
          high = high + 0.2;
        ```

        You can change those numbers to change how quickly your rectangle grows.

        # Order of operations

        Let's look back at that ellipse we started drawing earlier. 

        ```
        ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        Add that right after your rect() inside your draw function to make your draw function read like this: 

        ```
        rect(10,20,wide,high);
        ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        wide = wide + 0.1;
        high = high + 0.2;
        ```

        Now run your app. 

        Notice that the ellipse is always on top of the rectangle. This is because every time the app runs, 60 times per second, it draws the rectangle, then draws the ellipse. The rectangle comes first in the script, so it is drawn first. The ellipse comes second so it is drawn second. 

        Flip the order of the ellipse and the rect to see what happens.

        # Working with colour

        The fill() method allows you to set the fill colour of any element you draw on your canvas. Once you set fill(), though, it applies to all draw commands that come after it. All colour values are supplied as RGB values. 

        ```
        fill(255,0,0);
        rect(10,20,wide,high);
        ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        The above makes both the rectangle and the ellipse bright red. But: 

        ```
        fill(255,0,0);
        rect(10,20,wide,high);
        fill(0,255,0);
        ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        This makes a red rectangle and a green ellipse on top of it. 

        Similarly, in setup() you can set background() as an rgb value to shift it away from this dull default gray. 

        ```
        background(15,200,80);

        You can use these values to identify where your shapes should appear on your canvas. For example, let's change the center of where our circle is drawn to make it match our mouse position. The circle can therefore track our mouse movements. 

        In your draw() function, adjust your ellipse command to:
        
        ```
          ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25);
        ```
        
        Now run your app.

        #Well that was weird

        The circle repeated itself all over the page! Goodness, that's not what we want. 

        The reason it did this is because processing repeats the draw() function 60 times per second, but it never clears away what it already drew on the canvas unless you explicitly tell it to do so. Right now, we have all of our original draw() commands executing one on top of the other. 

        The fix this, add this one line to the top of your draw() command. 

        ```
          background(15,200,80);
        ```

        You can reset the background of your app on each cycle so none of it draws on top of itself, making for a much cleaner, and more magic, look.

        # If statements in Processing
        
        The other part of what you can do inside your draw() function is write IF statements: conditionals that test all 60 times per second to see if they should run one way or the other. 

        This way, we can set a cap on how much our rectangle can grow.

        ```
        if (high >= 480) {
          console.log('all done');
        } else {
          wide = wide + 0.1;
          high = high + 0.2;
        }
        ```

        Tip: We use 480 because our canvas is 500 pixels tall and we start the rectangle 20 pixels from the top. 500 - 20 = 480

        #Behavioural IF statements

        You can also use IF statements to test where the user's mouse is and define behaviour based on that position.

        For example, you could test to see if the circle you're positioning around the mouse is inside the box, and change the colour of either the circle or the box because of that position. 

        This extensive list of conditions (four of them, one for each side of our square), asks if the mouse is inside the boundaries of our rectangle. 

        ```
        if (mouseX > 10 && mouseX < (wide + 10) && mouseY > 20 && mouseY < (high + 20)) {
          fill(255,0,0);
        } else {
          fill(0,0,255);
        }
        ```

        Tip: We use the +10 and the +20 on the conditions to accomodate the starting position of our rectangle, otherwise we would be measuring from the top corner of our canvas, not the top corner of our rectangle.

        #Exercise: "if" you're happy and you know it (~15 mins) 

        Expanding on these concepts, what if a circle only appeared where your mouse is, and followed your mouse around, when your mouse entered one of the rectangles? 

        1. Build two rectangles. 
        2. Make your rectangles change fill colour when your mouse enters them.
        3. Make a circle appear over your mouse when your mouse enters either rectangle. 

        Stretch goal: What if your circles changed size depending on how far into the rectangle they are? That would be cool.

        #Exercise answer

        The trick here is to have multiple if statements in your draw() function. That can be hard to read, but it also becomes very powerful once you wrap your head around what's happening.

        This is just one way to do it and you may have come up with another way that also makes sense. The only thing that matters is that it works and it meets your goals.

        Note that the trick here is that you technically detect where your rectangle is going to be before you even draw it, which can be a bit of a mind bend.

        ```javascript
        if (mouseX > 10 && mouseX < (wide + 10) && mouseY > 20 && mouseY < (high + 20)) {
          fill(255,0,0);
          rect(10,20,wide,high);
          fill(0,255,0);
          ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25);
        } else {
          fill(0,0,255);
          rect(10,20,wide,high);
        }

        if (mouseX > 10 && mouseX < (wide + 10) && mouseY > 80 && mouseY < (high + 80)) {
          fill(0,255,0);
          rect(10,80,wide,high);
          fill(255,0,0);
          ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25);
        } else {
          fill(0,0,255);
          rect(10,80,wide,high);
        }

        #Stretch goal answer

        Changing the size of the circle depending on where your mouse is means you have to modify that one line: ellipse.

        Instead of a static value of 25 for the height and width, we can pay attention to where the mouse is. Then we can incorporate that number into a calculation to determine the new height. That might look like: 

        ```
        25 + (mouseY / 3)
        ``` 

        The 25 is our base value, the smallest we want the circle to be. Then we add the mouseY to it. The / 3 is just to make the difference less jarring. It's stylistic. Mess with it and see what happens. 

        The full solution is: 

        ```javascript
        if (mouseX > 10 && mouseX < (wide + 10) && mouseY > 20 && mouseY < (high + 20)) {
          fill(255,0,0);
          rect(10,20,wide,high);
          fill(0,255,0);
          ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25 + (mouseY / 3), 25 + (mouseY / 3));
        } else {
          fill(0,0,255);
          rect(10,20,wide,high);
        }

        if (mouseX > 10 && mouseX < (wide + 10) && mouseY > 80 && mouseY < (high + 80)) {
          fill(0,255,0);
          rect(10,80,wide,high);
          fill(255,0,0);
          ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25 + (mouseY / 3), 25 + (mouseY / 3));
        } else {
          fill(0,0,255);
          rect(10,80,wide,high);
        }

        Open the project folder in the course files. 

        Look at "data.txt".

        There 5 numbers in it. They are separated by commas, which is a common way to store data like this. 

        The five numbers refer to deliveries, bounces, opens, clicks, unsubscribers, in a single Mailchimp report.

        #Telling processing how to access the data

        Processing comes with a method that allows you to read data from a text file and store it in a variable. 

        We don't want to do this every single time the draw() function runs, 60 times per second, we just want to do it once at the top of the program so we don't spend so much energy reading data.

        We start by creating a new function, called preload(). preload() is responsible for loading any extra resources our project might need, so that they're ready to go when setup() and draw() are called.

        ```
        let myData;

        function preload() {
          myData = loadStrings('data.txt');
        }
        ```

        Why do we declare `let myData;` outside of preload()? If we put it inside, it would get thrown out as soon as the function ended!
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Working with the data
        
        Now that we know for sure that our file will be loaded when setup() is called, we're free to play with it in setup().

        ```
          let mailChimpData;

          function setup() {
            //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
            mailChimpData = myData[0].split(',');
            console.log(mailChimpData);
          }
        ```

        This is steps. The first step is to grab the text data. Then we need to actually split it into an array so we can treat each value in it separately. 

        The split() function allows you to specify the comma as the separating character, splitting each value from each other using the commas. 

        The console.log() at the end allows you to see the final list of data, presented as a nice clean array. 
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Working with the data

        Altogether, it looks like this:

        ```
          let myData;
          let mailChimpData;

          function preload() {
            myData = loadStrings('data.txt');
          }

          function setup() {
            //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
            mailChimpData = myData[0].split(',');
            console.log(mailChimpData);
          }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Looping through your data

        Once you import your data, you can draw different shapes on your canvas in accordance with your data. You can also control the size of those drawings by using the data as attributes like "width" and "height."

        As before, you should add createCanvas() and background() calls in your setup() function to establish the base of your canvas: 

        ```
          function setup() {
            //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
            createCanvas(700,500);
            background(0,0,0);

            // ...
          }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Looping through your data

        Now, just like the last example, we can setup a draw() function that will loop 60 times per second to draw our data. 

        ```
        function draw() {
          //The Code you want to draw in goes here.
          background(0,0,0);
           for (let i = 0; i < mailChimpData.length; i++) {
            let dataValue = parseInt(mailChimpData[i]);
            fill(255,255,255);
            ellipse(100, 100, dataValue, dataValue);
           }
        };

        ```

        This places five circles of varying widths directly on top of each other, with the centres of each of them at 100 pixels in from the left, and 100 pixels down from the top. 

        Why do we need parseInt()? Our mailChimpData array contains **strings**, but ellipse() wants **numbers**. We call parseInt() to transform our strings into integers (numbers without decimal places).

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #But wait a second...

        Don't we want the circles to be hollow so we can see through them? And shouldn't they be spread out a bit? 

        Yes, yes they should be. 
      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stroke colours

        So far we've dealt with colours in terms of their fill. But you can also determine their stroke colour - the thin line that forms the outer edge of the circle. You can also determine that line's width. 

        Enter: The stroke values. 

        ```
        stroke(255,255,255);
        noFill();
        ```

        These two lines will make sure there isn't any fill in your circles, and they'll give it a white stroke. Go ahead and pick your favourite colour to use.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Scooch over a bit

        We want our circles to all live next to each other, not on top of each other. Friendly neighbours, not roommates. 

        So in our loop, we can change the center of each circle individually by adding another variable. Before the loop starts -- inside your draw() function but outside of the loop drawing your circles -- add this variable:

        ```
        let toTheLeftToTheLeft = 75;
        ```

        Then you can change your ellipsis() command to include that variable on the x-axis -- the horizontal axis. 

        ```
        ellipse(toTheLeftToTheLeft, 100, dataValue, dataValue);
        ```

        Then, at the bottom of your loop, change that variable for the next circle in line to be drawn. 

        ```
        toTheLeftToTheLeft = toTheLeftToTheLeft + 130;
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #All together now

        At this point, your complete draw() function should look something like this: 

        ```
        function draw() {
            //The Code you want to draw in goes here.
            background(0,0,0);
            let toTheLeftToTheLeft = 75;
            for (let i = 0; i < mailChimpData.length; i++) {
              let dataValue = parseInt(mailChimpData[i]);
              stroke(255,255,255);
              noFill();
              ellipse(toTheLeftToTheLeft, 100, dataValue, dataValue);
              toTheLeftToTheLeft = toTheLeftToTheLeft + 130;
            }
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        # Responding to the user

        Now we have several circles on our page, but isn't it more fun when they show the user something when they hover over them? 

        Of course it is. 

        This part is a little complicated, but if you place this function just above your setup() function, you can test to see if your cursor is inside each circle. 

        ```javascript
        function overCircle(centerX, centerY, diameter) {
          let disX = centerX - mouseX;
          let disY = centerY - mouseY;
          if(sqrt(sq(disX) + sq(disY)) < diameter/2 ) {
            return true;
          } else {
            return false;
          }
        }
        ```

        Activating it and making it respond to the user: That's on the next slide.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Responding to the user

        That function exists to test if your cursor is inside the circle. Now we need to call it inside our draw() function so we can use it. Update your draw function to call that function each time a circle is drawn: 

        ```
        if (overCircle(toTheLeftToTheLeft, 100, dataValue) {
          stroke(255,0,0);
        } else {
          stroke(255,255,255);
        }

        ```

        This tests, 60 times per second, if your cursor is inside the circle. If it is, it draws a red stroke. If it's not, it draws a white stroke. Handy!

        # Labels

        It's starting to look really great. Now let's just add some labels so we know what we're looking at. 

        Working with text in Processing is super easy. There's a method called text() that handles all the text you need to place in your graphic, as well as it's positioning. All in one go. 

        So before you adjust your toTheLeftToTheLeft variable, but after you add your ellipsis, add these two lines: 

        ```
        fill(255,255,255);
        text('Test Text', toTheLeftToTheLeft - 25, 200);
        ```

        We add the -25 so that we can backtrack the text to center it under the circle. The 200 is how far from the top of the canvas the text is. "Test Text" is the text that will actually appear in your graphic. 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Labels that mean something

        Instead of "test text" it would be helpful if our text described the circle it was under. To do that, we'll need an array of labels to use, in the same order as our circle data. 

        So if our circle data is:
        
        ```
        231,85,87,16,2
        ```

        Then our labels need to be: 

        ```
        deliveries, bounces, opens, clicks, unsubscribers
        ```

        So at the top of your sketchProc() function, where you set up your data import, you can add this one line to establish your labels: 

        ```
        let labels = ['Deliveries', 'Bounces', 'Opens', 'Clicks', 'Unsubscribers'];
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown data-toc>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Add the right labels

        Now instead of "Test text" you can insert your appropriate label. Change your text() command to: 

        ```
        text(labels[i], toTheLeftToTheLeft - 25, 200);

        ```
        The labels[i] will refers to master array of labels at the top of the program, and the i refers to the loop through your circle construction. 

        So just as your app builds its first circle, it grabs its first label. As it builds its second circle, it grabs the second label. And so on. 

        Loops are great.
